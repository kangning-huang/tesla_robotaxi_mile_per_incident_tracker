The Autonomous Vehicle Operator (AVO) intervened to move closer to the lead vehicle as another vehicle in the right lane attempted to merge left, preventing it. After the merging car stopped, the AVO pulled closer to the lead vehicle, removing any space to merge. As the lead vehicle began to move, both the AVO and the vehicle to the right immediately accelerated, while the merging vehicle moved left into the side of the May AV.

As the Ego accelerates, a pedestrian begins moving and enters the crosswalk from the other side of the intersection. This activates the rule-based crosswalk logic. Ego determines that it is able to stop before the crosswalk without exceeding our max deceleration threshold, which triggers an in-policy stopping reaction for the crosswalk. The Ego brakes to yield for the pedestrian. The vehicle trailing the Ego accelerates, making contact with the rear-end of the Ego. In the 2.5 seconds between the start of the Ego braking and the collision, the rear vehicle accelerated from 0.2 to 6.1 m/s (0.4 to 13.6 mph) without slowing until after the collision occurred. In response to this incident, immediate mitigations were made, in that the vehicle operators (AVOs) operate all intersections in manual mode.  This remained in place until January 12, when we received a solution which instituted a reduction of the 3.5 m/s2 parameter, in order to prevent the Ego from yielding to pedestrians in crosswalks that are still far from the Egoâs lane if such yielding would induce braking.",

The Waymo AV was traveling northwestbound on The Embarcadero in the right lane when it slowed to a stop for a queue of traffic for a red light at the intersection with Harrison Street. After the light turned green and traffic ahead advanced, the Waymo AV proceeded forward. A pickup truck traveling northwestbound on The Embarcadero in the left lane proceeded forward and a rear seat passenger of the pickup truck threw a traffic cone from the window and into the roadway, and the traffic cone landed in the Waymo AV's lane of travel. As the Waymo AV proceeded forward the front of the Waymo AV made contact with the traffic cone. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage.

The May planner initially selects a trajectory it believes will safely complete the turn. However, as the Ego begins the turn, it re-evaluates the situation and detects a significant risk of striking the curb. At that point, the planner shifts focus from avoiding the curb entirely to minimizing the severity of a potential curb strike. To reduce speed before the expected contact, the Ego brakes at 3.5 m/sÂ²). Because the trailing vehicle is following so closely, this deceleration makes a rear-end collision likely. The Ego predicts a potential rear-end collision and elects to reduce brake force to lessen the impact severity. Moments later, the trailing vehicle strikes the rear driver-side bumper of the Ego and then drives away. Future improvements are underway to give the planner a policy option to steer away from curbs. This new capability will help the vehicle avoid situations where braking becomes the only remaining way to manage close curb proximity.",

As the Ego proceeded, the system initially recognized the static retaining wall as a large, non-rectangular object. As the Ego approaches the wall, the resulting density of lidar returns on the object (wall) exceeds the detectors maximum limitation. The newer lidar points, toward the forward edge of the elongated object, exceeding the limit were filtered out, causing the track to disappear when the ego approached 5m from the track (i.e. the wall). The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the road edge was incorrectly marked in that section.  The road edge was drawn through the retaining wall and thus the vehicle did not have any prior knowledge about the edge of the road. As a result, the Ego drove too close to the wall, scraping it at a speed of 2 meters per second while driving straight (i.e. in lane-nominal policy) with no nudge or veer corrections. There was no damage to the wall. The limitation leading to the lost track affects Software versions v26.0 (when the Open World Tracklet v2 feature was introduced) through v31.0. This is the only known instance of this failure mode, and in v32.0 an optimization was made to remove the LIDAR threshold entirely and mitigate the vulnerability.  Furthermore, the incorrect road edge annotation was corrected shortly after this incident and the map updated for the deployed vehicles.",

A vehicle travelling to the left of the May shuttle (ego) in the non-AV lane performed a right hand turn across the May vehicleÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs path.  Given the full stopping power and the limited space with which the ego had to stop, the ego was physically unable to stop in time before impact.  The primary factor that led to this collision was human error on the part of the other vehicle that was required to yield to through traffic in the AV lane but did not.  Right turns across a straight lane are uncommon, and drivers are typically not used to them, however there are several signs that instruct other traffic to yield to the vehicles in the AV lane.  There were no autonomy faults or errors which led to this incident.
Update:
There was no indication of injury or request for medical attention at the scene. The police report states ""Driver 1 complained of neck pain.""

No passengers were on board at the time of the incident. There were no injuries reported at the scene, and both vehicles were driven away from the site of the collision.

Given construction in this area, vehicle 003C was under manual control while driving along E Independent Dr. The operator engaged the automated driving system as they exited the construction area, approximately one second prior to the collision. Vehicle data and dashcam video indicate the operator attempted to intervene but was unable to avoid contact by the other vehicle.

The Jacksonville Sheriffâs Office responded to the scene. The driver of the other vehicle was cited for making an improper turn, and the responding officer noted that vehicle 003C was not at fault for the accident.",

The vehicle was traveling northbound on Las Vegas Boulevard in the second of four lanes from the left, approaching the intersection with Charleston Boulevard.
 
While stopped at a red traffic signal, an adult male pedestrian began crossing Las Vegas Boulevard from the west side of the street, several hundred feet away from a designated crosswalk. The pedestrian proceeded southbound across multiple lanes and paused on a median located ahead and to the left of the AV. The AV detected and classified the pedestrian the entire time.
 
When the traffic signal turned green, the pedestrian remained stopped on the median. Given that the pedestrian remained stopped in place, the AV began to move forward slowly at approximately 2.5 mph and continued to correctly detect and classify the pedestrian. The pedestrian, holding what appears to be an item in a plastic bag, suddenly stepped into the far-left turn lane ahead of the AV, the AV immediately came to a complete stop still in the second  lane. The pedestrian continued crossing, making a light physical contact with the rear driverâs side of the vehicle before continuing across the remaining three lanes of traffic still outside of the crosswalk.
 
The vehicle operator then disengaged the autonomous system and pulled over to complete an incident report. No police were notified. There were no injuries, no damage, and no airbag deployments. The pedestrian did not stop at the scene and the identity of the pedestrian is unknown.",

A minivan reversed out of a parking position (perpendicular parking to road lane) from the right side of the road into the shuttle¢ÂÂs path and struck the shuttle from the side.
After the incident a supervisor from the Riverside Transport Agency RTA (operator or the vehicle) was called to the side. The RTA supervisor recorded the incident according to RTAs protocols.
In addition to the Ohmio trainer/supervisor being on the vehicle additional Ohmio personal was called to the side as well.

Summary of Events:
-Upon detecting the minivan in the side envelope, the system issued a brake command within 5ms.
-Brake pressure began rising 58ms after the command and exceeded 90% of the requested pressure 164ms after the initial command.
-The minivan reversed out of a parking space perpendicular to the Ohmio LiftÃ¢ÂÂs direction of travel and struck the Lift on the side.
-The minivan continued reversing until contact occurred.
-The elapsed time from first detection of the minivan in the side envelope to impact was approximately 358ms.
-The vehicle came to a complete stop in 1.178 seconds.

In Summary:
The other car pushing out from the parking position did not give way as would have been required.
The Ohmio Lift detected the other car getting into the right side of its safety envelope just 358ms before the impact. The reaction time of the Ohmio Lift was as expected in terms of reacting to the signal and initiating a brake maneuver. However, the short time and distance between the other car entering the Ohmio Lift safety envelope (and consequently its track) was too short to avoid the collision. Even if the Ohmio Lift had come to a complete stop before the actual impact the collision would most likely have happened but potentially at a slightly different position.",

The primary factor that led to this collision was human error on the part of the other vehicle that was required to yield to through traffic in the AV lane but did not.  Right turns across a straight lane are uncommon, and drivers are typically not used to them, however there is a metal street sign that instructs other traffic to yield to the vehicles in the AV lane.  There were no autonomy faults or errors which led to this incident.  Additionally, there is a second traffic light at this intersection that warns public drivers to yield to the AV shuttle.

A Motional AV with VIN [XXX] was operating in autonomous mode in Las Vegas, Nevada at approximately 5:06PM PT, with a safety driver at the wheel and an engineer in the front passenger seat.
The AV was traveling [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. On the median of the road after the intersection were a series of traffic cones immediately to the AV's left. A piece of debris, which upon viewing the video recording appears to be a large garbage bag, was stuck on and hanging from the lead cone into the road. The AV perceived this debris as a road obstruction, causing the AV to brake. An SUV taxi was following the AV and made physical contact with the rear of the AV.
Following the contact, the safety driver assumed control of the vehicle and safely pulled over to a safe location to initiate Motional's incident response protocol. The rear of the AV had a minor dent less than $1000 in damage, and there were no injuries, nor were airbags deployed. Law enforcement was not contacted at the time of the incident.
Law enforcement was not contacted at the time of the incident if a police report becomes available, a copy may be provided by Motional.",
