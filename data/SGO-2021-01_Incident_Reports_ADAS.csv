The customer reported that before this incident, he had ""noticed it would start to jerk the wheel,"" but he ""always had hands on [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] tried to correct it,"" but ""it was semi-locked and wouldn't turn,"" resulting in the vehicle crashing into a cable barrier. The customer alleged ""his left shoulder hurt"". The customer requested an inspection of the vehicle.
The subject Kia K4 is equipped with Lane Following Assist (""LFA""), Lane Keeping Assist (""LKA""), and Smart Cruise Control (""SCC""). It is unclear which feature the customer is referring to by ""lane assist."" However, only LFA and SCC engaged at the same could qualify as a Level 2 ADAS feature under the proper conditions.

LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane. 

Kia has attempted to contact the customer on several occasions to obtain additional information to evaluate the incident but customer has not responded.

** Monthly Update Report 12/15/2025***
KA received the subject vehicle's ACU and downloaded the vehicle's EDR data, which indicates that Smart Cruise Control was not engaged during the 5-seconds prior to the crash and thus vehicle was not being operated at LVL 2. The vehicle was steered rapidly to the left while being driven at highway speeds and then an evasive maneuver was performed steering the vehicle to the right. This amount of steering input exceeds what Lane Keep Asist / Lane Follow Asist can apply.  No Advanced Driving Assistance Systems that provide steering inputs were found to have been a contributing or causal factor in the collision. This information, including documents (subject vehicle EDR report, photos, customer care case, etc.) were provided to ODI engineer, Joseph Teitelman on 12/5/2025 per his request.",

The driver indicated that he attempted to take evasive maneuvering which led to a spin, impact with a metal barrier, and a subsequent rollover. The airbags deployed, and the vehicle was towed from the scene. No injuries were reported. The driver alleges that Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering Assist (LCA) were engaged prior to the incident.  Ford confirms that the vehicle involved was equipped with Co-Pilot360 Assist+, which includes ACC and LCA. 
At this time, Ford has not received any vehicle or connected-vehicle data related to this incident. Ford is currently investigating whether these ADAS features were engaged at the time of the incident.",

Upon engagement, the vehicle speed increased, and the steering wheel could not be turned leftward and the vehicle proceeded straight. An Illinois Traffic Crash Report stated that while attempting to make a left-hand turn, the driver continued to press the accelerator pedal and ran off the roadway onto private property. The vehicle struck 8-10 concrete landscaping bricks that were around a tree, causing disabling damage to the vehicle. There was no airbag deployment, and the vehicle was towed from the scene. The driver was transported to the hospital for observation for high blood pressure. The customer indicated that the ACC had not been in use that day.
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 10/07/2025. The vehicle was under repair and the front bumper cover, left headlight, left fender, and driver's door were removed. Three tires and the electric power steering (EPS) gearbox were replaced. In the interior, a genuine all season floor mat was secured to the retaining pins on the driver's floorboard. There were no abnormalities with the brake or accelerator pedal. SSM data indicated there were no DTCs before the collision and multiple DTCs were detected due to the crash and disassembly during repairs.

[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]

Based on the vehicle inspection and the data acquired, Subaru determined that the ACC and LCF had not been engaged on the day of the incident and there were no abnormalities with the vehicle's steering, accelerator or brakes. The data, further supported by the crash report, indicated the event experienced by the customer was likely due to operational error by the driver.",Y

On October 17, 2025, Toyota received an initial contact from a rental car company, alleging that a driver of a rental vehicle was involved in a crash, and the driver claimed that a malfunction with the adaptive cruise control setting caused the crash.  The driver described that while driving on a rural highway with adaptive cruise control engaged, while passing a turnoff on the left side, a malfunction warning appeared that said ""adaptive cruise control malfunction"" and the vehicle pulled hard to the left and the steering locked.  As the driver attempted to straighten the vehicle, it impacted the center cable divider.  The driver alleged the steering wheel then released and caused the car to steer across two lanes of traffic to the right and the vehicle rolled.  As a result of the crash, the driver alleged that: the curtain airbags deployed there was damage to the left side and top of vehicle including a broken driver's window and rear windscreen; the driver suffered from a concussion and an occupants' left arm was cut, both treated at an emergency room; the vehicle was towed away from the scene.

The customer alleged Ã¢ÂÂhis left shoulder hurt.Ã¢ÂÂ. The customer requested an inspection of the vehicle.
The subject Kia K4 is equipped with Lane Following Assist (Ã¢ÂÂLFAÃ¢ÂÂ), Lane Keeping Assist (Ã¢ÂÂLKAÃ¢ÂÂ), and Smart Cruise Control (Ã¢ÂÂSCCÃ¢ÂÂ). It is unclear which feature the customer is referring to by Ã¢ÂÂlane assist.Ã¢ÂÂ However, only LFA and SCC engaged at the same could qualify as a Level 2 ADAS feature under the proper conditions.

LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane. 

Kia has attempted to contact the customer on several occasions to obtain additional information to evaluate the incident but customer has not responded.",

The vehicle started pulling to the right and then collided with metal divider on the passenger side. Both the driver front airbag and driver knee airbags deployed. Honda asked how he was doing, which he informed me better. Honda asked if he had any injuries, which he said he had a scratch on his wrist. He did not know what scratched him. Honda asked about the damage to the vehicle, which he informed that the vehicle is not drivable. The right rear tire was flat, damage to the right side of fender, also right-side bumper in front, left front bumper as well, scratches on both passenger side front and rear door. Driver side, he mentioned that there was plastic piece that fell off, not sure what that was. Honda asked him about ACC, how long he had been using, and what speed it was sent for. Customer started he was using the ACC about half hour after he started his drive. It was sent to 78 MPH. Honda asked what the speed limit was for that area of highway, which he advised about 70MPH. Honda asked him about LKAS, how long has been using it, and if he recalled what the LKAS icon was prior to the accident. He also said that he turned LKAS on about half hour after he started his drive. He said prior the accident it was green. Honda asked if he recalls the conditions or markings on the road, which he could recall partially as it happened all so fast. Since it was a two-lane highway going east, his vehicle was on the right side. The left side he recalls the lines being white and dashed. Honda asked about the right side, but he could not recall, maybe solid white, but he was not sure. He mentioned there was a downside hill when he goes off the road, so road was higher than side of road. Honda asked around what time this occurred and weather conditions, which he advised around 12 PM, and it was sunny. Honda asked about the vehicle starting to go right if he recalls the steering conditions at the time. The vehicle was driving straight, then started going right. He mentioned he had his hand on the steering wheel. Honda asked once it started pulling right, did he apply steering correction, but he did not recall. Honda asked if he recalled putting his foot on the brake pedal, either right before hitting the railing or after. He does not think he did right before hit railing. He does recall after hitting the railing as that is probably what stopped the vehicle. Honda asked him if he recalls how long it was from vehicle starting to go right, to hitting the barrier, which he did not recall. Honda asked if metal barrier was solid, like one metal strip, or if there were two, with a gap in between, but he could not recall. After the accident, police did come out, and he received a $210 citation ticket, and a copy of the report.

The customer stated he was on an 8-hour drive and was on a two-way road and to not get tired he had LKAS and ACC on. The customer stated that ACC was set to 65 MPH and the distance was set to two bars. The customer stated there was only a line in the middle of the road since it was only a two-way road but can't remember the color of the line. The customer stated that suddenly the vehicle steered to the right, and he hit a fence. The customer can't remember if the LKAS indicator line were filled or blank but stated that it was hard to control the steering as it was steering itself. The customer stated he drove the vehicle away from that and when he got to a railroad crossing, he stepped on the brakes and the vehicle did not stop and he lost control of the vehicle. The customer stated that this is after the first incident of hitting the fence and ACC and LKAS were not on at this time because there were errors on the dash. The customer stated he contacted his insurance company, and they said this will be a total loss but hadn't not processed the total loss yet.

The customer stated that she depressed the brake pedal, but the vehicle speed was not slowing. AEB activated but the subject vehicle struck the vehicle in the lane of travel in front. The driver's frontal and knee airbags deployed and the vehicle was towed from the scene. There were no injuries reported.
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 7/17/2025. The vehicle sustained underride collision damage on the frontal plane. The left side of the front bumper beam was pushed upwards, and the battery was wedged into the M/B Fuse box and ECM connector. The stability control module was also damaged in the collision.

She reported that her daughter was transported to the hospital after the incident and had sustained bruises, limited mobility, and stitches to the back of her head. She requested the black box for the vehicle.
In addition, the customer suggested that before the accident, her daughter had taken the vehicle to a Kia dealership with a concern about the HDA and the dealership identified no concerns.
The subject Kia Niro is equipped with Highway Drive Assist (HDA), LFA, and SCC. LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Kia confirmed that Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were active from approximately 19 seconds to 7 seconds prior to the collision. At 7 seconds pre-collision, LFA was disengaged.
Kia is currently working to obtain additional information to evaluate this incident.",

Ford is providing an update on the incident data and the Police Report.
On July 29, 2025, Ford provided the agency with the Police Report and a summary of the retrieved Event Data Recorder (EDR) and telematic data related to the incident. The Police Report indicated the Jeep Compass was traveling eastbound on [XXX] and, while pulling into a gas station, failed to yield, causing a collision with the Ford Expedition traveling westbound in the opposite lane.
The EDR and telematic data indicated that Adaptive Cruise Control was active prior to the accident and was canceled by the driver pressing the brake before the collision. Lane Centering Assist (LCA) was not active during the captured data window. Therefore, the engagement of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Level 2 (ADAS L2) features cannot be confirmed for this incident.",

Customer claimed that another vehicle was stopped at a traffic light and the subject vehicle ""did not slow down as expected."" Customer then ""attempted to disengage the ACC and manually apply the brakes,"" but ""the system failed to respond, preventing me from stopping the vehicle."" Customer added that ""the ACC system did not reduce speed appropriately or allow me to take manual control in [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] to avoid the crash."" Customer reported there was a ""significant collision"", during which the airbags deployed. He confirmed that he was able to drive the vehicle away from the scene.
Customer reported sustaining injuries to his thumb and stomach ""because of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] seat belt"" and requested warranty coverage, a vehicle replacement, and compensation. The customer confirmed they were not transported to the hospital and is not currently under any medical attention.
Kia Customer Care (""CC"") contacted customer to obtain additional information regarding the incident. Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were also on at the time of the incident and provided post-incident photos of the vehicle. The photos provided by the customer show damage to the center portion of the front bumper, consistent with contact against the rear tow hitch on the other vehicle which is also visible in the photos. Kia escalated the case for further review.
Kia confirmed that both SCC and LFA were engaged at the time of the crash. While the customer reported that HDA was also active, Kia confirmed that HDA was not engaged at the time of the crash. Kia also reviewed the ECU data which confirmed that the brake pedal was pressed two seconds before impact, which disengaged the SCC system. The data also indicates that the Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (""FCA"") system detected a vehicle ahead and issued a Level 1 audible and visual warning prior to the collision. These data points suggest that the driver did not brake early or forcefully enough to avoid the collision.
The subject Kia Sportage is equipped with HDA, LFA, and Smart Cruise Control (SCC). Another name for SCC is Adaptive Cruise Control, which is how the customer refers to the system. LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Further, post-impact drive cycle data shows no braking concerns. The vehicle was driven away from the scene without reported braking issues, and the brake system continued to function as expected.
Kia is currently working to obtain additional information to evaluate this incident.
*** 8/15/2025 Monthly Update ***
On July 15, 2025, Kia received a request from Mr. Teitelman via email for materials relating to the incident report. On July 23, 2025, Kia provided Mr. Teitelman the requested information via NHTSA's SLFTS portal. In addition, the customer has since stated he is unable to provide any additional information because he sold the vehicle to his insurance provider. Kia has no further information.",

On 6/28/24 claimant notified Nissan Consumer Affairs of an accident which reportedly occurred on 5/[XXX]/24. The claimant states that ProPilot Assist was in use and did not stop the vehicle. Claimant states he was ""prevented from braking,"" explaining that the brakes had failed. Claimant reports neck pain and a small scratch on right thumb and finger, but did not seek medical attention. Claimant stated the complaint is related to brake failure and claimant is not reporting a failure of the ProPilot Assist performance.
Nissan inspected the subject vehicle in connection with the brake failure complaint and found the vehicle's braking system to be fully functional. No related DTCs were noted. AEB warning lamp was off, indicating a fully functional system. EDR data shows the vehicle was traveling at 64.6mph prior to the brake application applied 3 seconds before time zero. Vehicle data shows that prior to impact, vehicle speed had been reduced to below 20 mph, with AEB activating max braking 0.5 second before the crash.  Of particular note, the driver was issued a citation by police for following a vehicle too closely as he was approaching an intersection with a 25 deg right hand turn and the EDR system does not record the status of PPA system. According to the vehicle investigation report, the subject vehicle was towed from the incident scene.  
Nissan denied the claim because there is no evidence of any manufacturing or product defect that would have caused or contributed to this incident.
On July 22, 2025, during review of the vehicle inspection report for this incident in preparation of Nissan's response to EA25-001, Nissan determined that this incident was reportable under the criteria of the Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 and is therefore submitting this 5-day and Final Report.",

On July [XXX], 2025, Toyota received an initial contact from the driver of a rental vehicle involved in the crash. The driver described that cruise control was engaged with lane trace assist/lane departure assist and pre-collision system turned on leading up to the crash event. The driver alleged that while driving on a highway, the lane trace assist/lane departure assist failed to engage and keep vehicle within lanes, and the PCS failed to detect the median of the freeway and slow down the vehicle before impact. The driver stated he noticed twice before the incident the lane trace assist/lane departure would keep the vehicle in the lane. The driver stated the third time, the vehicle drifted out of the lane, and the driver side of the vehicle impacted the freeway median. The driver alleged the driver assistance features did not function properly and failed to prevent the accident.
As a result of the crash, the driver alleged that: the airbags deployed there was significant damage to the front driver's side of the vehicle, including the wheel, tire, bumper, and fender one of the five occupants seated in the left rear position sustained injuries to her left rib cage that required emergency room treatment (seat belt use unknown) and the vehicle was towed from the scene and deemed a total loss. 
The driver stated the California Highway Patrol responded to the crash and provided report numbers ""NCIC - 9650"".",

She tried to correct the vehicle, but it fought her, went air borne, and hit trees and bushes knocking them down. Customer alleged sustaining multiple injuries and that she was transported to the hospital. Customer requested that Kia fix the problem with the vehicle, a replacement EV9, and compensation for her injuries. Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were on at the time of the incident.
Kia confirmed that HDA was not enabled in the 30 seconds prior to the crash, but SCC and LFA were enabled simultaneously during a 1 second period in the 20 seconds prior to crash.
The subject Kia EV9 is equipped with HDA, LFA, and SCC. LFA is a supplemental system that detects lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the drivers steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. SCC is a supplemental system that helps to detect a vehicle ahead, maintain the distance from the vehicle ahead, and set the speed. The functionality of these systems is contingent upon several outside factors, and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Kia is working to inspect the vehicle, but has no further information at this time.",

According to the customer's statement, the vehicle was traveling at 65 MPH with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering (LCF) engaged. The driver alleged that the vehicle's brakes were not operating and that after a mile, she had to crash into the highway median. The frontal and side airbags deployed, and the vehicle was towed from the scene.
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 6/24/2025. The vehicle sustained extensive damage to the front right side. The front right wheel, tire, axle housing, brake caliper, brake rotor, axle shaft, and strut were missing. Additionally, the front right brake hose and ABS wiring harness were severed. The front right side of the radiator support was pushed rearward, resulting in contact with the front timing cover. The impact caused the timing cover to fracture, exposing the camshaft sprockets. As a result of this damage, the engine could not be started.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
Based on the vehicle inspection and the data acquired, Subaru determined that there was no abnormality with the vehicle braking system and that ADAS was not engaged within 30 seconds of the incident. The customer had manually cancelled ACC approximately 1 mile before the incident and had then likely mistakenly depressed the accelerator pedal rather than the brake pedal. The stability control system successfully reduced the vehicle's speed from 67.7 MPH to 37.9 MPH prior to impact by modulating engine power and activating ABS.",Y

Customer claimed that another vehicle was stopped at a traffic light and the subject vehicle did not slow down as expected.  Customer then attempted to disengage the ACC and manually apply the brakes, but the system failed to respond, preventing me from stopping the vehicle.  Customer added that the ACC system did not reduce speed appropriately or allow me to take manual control in [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] to avoid the crash.  Customer reported there was a significant collision, during which the airbags deployed.  He confirmed that he was able to drive the vehicle away from the scene.
Customer reported sustaining injuries to his thumb and stomach because of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] seat belt and requested warranty coverage, a vehicle replacement, and compensation.  The customer confirmed they were not transported to the hospital and is not currently under any medical attention.
Kia Customer Care (CC) contacted customer to obtain additional information regarding the incident.  Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were also on at the time of the incident and provided post-incident photos of the vehicle.  The photos provided by the customer show damage to the center portion of the front bumper, consistent with contact against the rear tow hitch on the other vehicle which is also visible in the photos.  Kia escalated the case for further review. 
Kia confirmed that both SCC and LFA were engaged at the time of the crash.  While the customer reported that HDA was also active, Kia confirmed that HDA was not engaged at the time of the crash.  Kia also reviewed the ECU data which confirmed that the brake pedal was pressed two seconds before impact, which disengaged the SCC system.  The data also indicates that the Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) system detected a vehicle ahead and issued a Level 1 audible and visual warning prior to the collision.  These data points suggest that the driver did not brake early or forcefully enough to avoid the collision.
The subject Kia Sportage is equipped with HDA, LFA, and Smart Cruise Control (SCC). Another name for SCC is Adaptive Cruise Control, which is how the customer refers to the system.  LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the drivers steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes.  The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Further, post-impact drive cycle data shows no braking concerns.  The vehicle was driven away from the scene without reported braking issues, and the brake system continued to function as expected.  
Kia is currently working to obtain additional information to evaluate this incident.",
